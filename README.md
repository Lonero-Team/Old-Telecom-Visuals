# Old Telecom Case Study
Telecom Towers take up a lot of space In order to allow us to communicate through GSM networks and the internet. Utilizing RAWGraphs, we look at various data visualizations of telecom towers in state level deployment. These visualizations are meant to fulfill the purpose of informing readers about how much infrastructure is required in order to get this off the ground. With technologies such as the decentralized-internet and its SDK, one is able to make a new type of wireless communications protocol that doesnâ€™t need all this infrastructure to fulfill such purpose, just devices.
